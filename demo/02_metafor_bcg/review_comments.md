## Major Issues

| ID | Category | Issue |
|----|----------|-------|
| M1 | C | **Missing GRADE certainty-of-evidence assessment.** PRISMA 2020 requires assessment of certainty for each outcome. No summary-of-findings table is provided. This is a mandatory element for most journal submissions of systematic reviews. |
| M2 | C | **Per-study risk of bias results not reported.** The Methods section names the Cochrane RoB tool, but individual study assessments are absent. A traffic-light figure and summary RoB table are standard expectations. |
| M3 | D | **Limited novelty — re-analysis of a classic dataset.** The BCG meta-analysis by Colditz et al. (1994) is among the most cited meta-analyses in medicine. The present analysis applies updated methods (REML, prediction intervals) but does not incorporate new studies or new data. A real submission would need a clear statement of what this re-analysis adds beyond the original. |
| M4 | E | **Search strategy not reproducible.** Databases and date ranges are stated, but the full search syntax (Boolean operators, MeSH terms, filters) is not provided in an appendix. Reviewers would request this. |

## Minor Issues

| ID | Category | Issue |
|----|----------|-------|
| m1 | F | **Unverified references (5 items).** All references are marked [UNVERIFIED - DEMO]. In a real manuscript, DOIs/PMIDs must be verified against PubMed/CrossRef. |
| m2 | A | **No assessment of BCG strain as moderator.** Strain variation is discussed as a limitation but not analyzed. If strain data are available in the original dataset, a post-hoc subgroup or meta-regression could strengthen the analysis. |
| m3 | B | **Prediction interval interpretation could be stronger.** The prediction interval (0.155-1.549) crossing unity is noted but its clinical implications are understated. The Discussion should explicitly address what this means for policy decisions. |
| m4 | D | **Generic limitations opener.** The phrase "Several limitations of this analysis should be acknowledged" is formulaic. Consider leading with the most impactful limitation directly. |
| m5 | E | **Screening numbers are simulated.** The PRISMA flow diagram numbers (847 identified, 612 screened, etc.) appear constructed for demonstration purposes. In a real manuscript, these must reflect actual search yields. |

## Auto-Fix Summary (Phase 7.4)

- **Iteration 1**: Fixed 5 issues (M3, M4, m3, m4, m5) — score 72 → 79
- **Iteration 2**: Fixed 2 partial mitigations (M1 GRADE caveat, M2 RoB caveat) + AI pattern polish — score 79 → 82
- **Total fixed**: 7 issue-actions across 2 iterations
- **Skipped (requires human/analysis)**: M1 (full GRADE assessment), M2 (per-study RoB data), m1 (reference verification), m2 (BCG strain analysis)
- **Auto-fix limit reached**: Remaining issues require human review or additional data extraction.

## Strengths

1. Complete meta-analytic pipeline from data to manuscript in a single reproducible workflow.
2. Proper heterogeneity reporting (I² + Q + tau² + prediction interval) — not just I² in isolation.
3. Meta-regression with R² provides a quantitative explanation for heterogeneity, not just description.
4. Publication bias assessed with three complementary methods (Egger, Begg, trim-and-fill).
5. Leave-one-out sensitivity analysis demonstrates robustness of the pooled estimate.
