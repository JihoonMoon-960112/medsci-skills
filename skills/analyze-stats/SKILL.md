# Statistical Analysis Skill

You are assisting a medical researcher with statistical analyses for medical research papers.
Generate reproducible code (Python preferred, R when necessary) that produces publication-ready
tables and figures following journal standards for medical imaging research.

## Data Privacy Check

Before reading any data file, check whether it might contain Protected Health Information (PHI):

1. If `*_deidentified.*` files exist in the working directory, use those preferentially.
2. If only raw CSV/Excel files exist (no `*_deidentified.*` counterpart), warn the user:
   > "이 데이터에 환자 식별정보(이름, 주민번호, 연락처 등)가 포함되어 있습니까?
   > 포함된 경우 `/deidentify` 스킬로 먼저 비식별화를 진행해주세요."
3. If the user confirms the data is already de-identified or contains no PHI, proceed.
4. **NEVER** display raw PHI values (names, phone numbers, RRN) in your output. If you
   encounter them while reading data, warn the user and suggest running `/deidentify`.

## Reference Files

- **Templates**: `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/templates/` -- reusable analysis scripts
- **Analysis guides**: `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/analysis_guides/` -- on-demand methodology references
- **Table standards**: `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/table-standards/` -- journal-specific table formatting
  - `table-standards.md` -- universal rules, AMA rules, footnote system, mistakes checklist
  - `journal-profiles/` -- YAML profiles per journal (radiology, jama, nejm, lancet, eur_rad, ajr)
  - `table-types/` -- templates per table type (Table 1, diagnostic accuracy, regression, meta-analysis, model comparison)
  - `tool-comparison.md` -- R/Python tool comparison and recommended pipelines
- **Figure style**: `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/style/figure_style.mplstyle`
- **Project data**: See CLAUDE.md for data locations under `2_Data/`

Read relevant templates before generating analysis code. For complex analysis types
(regression, propensity score, repeated measures), also load the corresponding guide
from `analysis_guides/` to ensure correct methodology and reporting.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Data Assessment

1. **Read the data file** (CSV, Excel, TSV, or other tabular format).
2. **Report to the user**:
   - Shape (rows x columns)
   - Column names and inferred types (continuous, categorical, ordinal, binary, datetime)
   - Missing values per column (count and percentage)
   - First 5 rows preview
   - Unique value counts for categorical columns
3. **Identify the analysis unit**: patient, exam, lesion, image, rater, study, etc.

### Phase 2: Analysis Plan

Based on the data structure and research question, propose an analysis plan:

1. **Auto-detect analysis type** from the table below, or accept user specification.
2. **List specific tests** to be performed.
3. **Identify primary and secondary endpoints**.
4. **State assumptions** that will be checked (normality, homogeneity, independence).
5. **Note any data cleaning** needed (recoding, outlier handling, missing data strategy).

Present the plan and **wait for user approval** before executing.

| Type | When to use | Python packages | R packages | Primary output |
|------|-------------|-----------------|------------|----------------|
| Table 1 (Demographics) | Baseline characteristics | pandas, scipy | tableone | Demographics table |
| Diagnostic Accuracy | Sensitivity/specificity/AUC | sklearn, scipy | pROC | ROC curve, performance table |
| Inter-rater Agreement | Multiple raters rating same items | krippendorff, pingouin | irr, psych | ICC/Kappa table |
| Meta-analysis | Pooling effect sizes across studies | -- | meta, metafor | Forest + funnel plots |
| DTA Meta-analysis | Pooling diagnostic accuracy across studies | -- | meta, metafor, mada | SROC + paired forest plots |
| Survey/Likert | Ordinal rating scales | pingouin, scipy | psych | Descriptive + reliability |
| Survival | Time-to-event outcomes | lifelines | survival | KM curves, Cox table |
| Group Comparison | Comparing 2+ groups | scipy, pingouin | -- | Test results + effect sizes |
| Correlation | Association between variables | scipy, pingouin | -- | Scatter + correlation matrix |
| Logistic Regression | Binary outcome + predictors | statsmodels, sklearn | -- | OR table, C-statistic, forest plot |
| Linear Regression | Continuous outcome + predictors | statsmodels | -- | Coefficient table, R², diagnostic plots |
| Propensity Score | Observational treatment comparison | sklearn, statsmodels | MatchIt, WeightIt, cobalt | Balance table, Love plot, weighted analysis |
| Repeated Measures | Longitudinal / multi-timepoint data | pingouin, statsmodels | lme4, nlme, geepack | Spaghetti plot, LMM/GEE/RM ANOVA results |

For **Logistic Regression**, **Linear Regression**, **Propensity Score**, and **Repeated Measures**:
load the corresponding guide from `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/analysis_guides/` before generating code.
For test selection guidance, load `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/analysis_guides/test_selection.md`.

### Phase 3: Execute

Generate and run a Python (preferred) or R script following these rules:

#### Script Structure

Every script MUST start with a reproducibility header:

```python
"""
Analysis: {description}
Date: {YYYY-MM-DD}
Random seed: 42
Python: {version}
Key packages: {package==version, ...}
"""
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
np.random.seed(42)
```

#### Execution Rules

1. **Random seed**: Always `np.random.seed(42)` or `set.seed(42)`.
2. **Figure style**: Always load the matplotlib style file:
   ```python
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   style_path = os.path.join(os.environ.get('CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR', '.'), 'references/style/figure_style.mplstyle')
   if os.path.exists(style_path):
       plt.style.use(style_path)
   ```
3. **Output files**: Save all outputs to the same directory as the input data, or to a
   user-specified output directory.
4. **Tables**: Save as CSV (for downstream use) AND print a formatted markdown/console version.
5. **Figures**: Save as both PDF (vector) and PNG (300 DPI).
6. **Console output**: Print a summary formatted for direct copy-paste into a Results section.

#### Assumption Checking

Before running parametric tests, always check and report:

- **Normality**: Shapiro-Wilk test (n < 50) or Kolmogorov-Smirnov (n >= 50), plus visual QQ plot
- **Homogeneity of variance**: Levene's test
- **If assumptions violated**: Use non-parametric alternatives and report why

#### Multiple Comparisons

- If running 3+ tests on the same dataset, apply Bonferroni or Benjamini-Hochberg correction.
- Always report both uncorrected and corrected p-values.
- State the correction method used.

#### Output Manifest

After all analyses complete, save a manifest file `_analysis_outputs.md` in the output directory:

```markdown
# Analysis Outputs
Generated: {YYYY-MM-DD}
Study type: {detected or user-specified type}

## Tables
- `table1_demographics.csv` -- Baseline characteristics
- `diagnostic_accuracy_table.csv` -- Performance metrics with 95% CIs

## Figures  
- `roc_curve.pdf` / `roc_curve.png` -- ROC curves (vector / 300 DPI)

## Data
- `predictions.csv` -- Per-subject model predictions with ground truth
```

This manifest enables downstream skills (`/make-figures`, `/write-paper`) to auto-discover analysis outputs without user intervention.

### Phase 4: Report

After execution, generate manuscript-ready text:

1. **Results paragraph**: 3-8 sentences with specific numbers, formatted as:
   - Continuous: "mean +/- SD" or "median (IQR)"
   - Proportions: "n/N (XX.X%)"
   - Test results: "statistic = X.XX, p = 0.XXX"
   - Effect sizes: "Cohen's d = X.XX (95% CI: X.XX-X.XX)"
   - AUC: "AUC = 0.XXX (95% CI: 0.XXX-0.XXX)"
2. **Table/figure captions**: Draft captions referencing table/figure numbers.
3. **Methods snippet**: 2-3 sentences describing the statistical methods used, suitable for
   the Methods section.

## Statistical Reporting Rules (Always Enforced)

These rules apply to ALL analyses without exception:

1. **Exact p-values**: Report exact values (e.g., p = 0.034), not inequalities.
   Exception: report as p < 0.001 when the value is below 0.001.
2. **Confidence intervals**: Always report 95% CIs for primary endpoints.
3. **Effect sizes**: Report alongside every p-value (Cohen's d, eta-squared, odds ratio,
   risk ratio, etc., as appropriate).
4. **Parametric vs non-parametric**: Choose based on assumption checks, not convenience.
   Report the assumption test results.
5. **Multiple comparisons**: Apply and explicitly report the correction method when
   performing 3+ comparisons.
6. **Sample size reporting**: Always state n for each group/analysis.
7. **Missing data**: Report how many cases were excluded and why.
8. **Decimal places**: p-values to 3 decimals, proportions to 1 decimal, means/SDs to
   appropriate precision for the measurement.

## Error Handling

- If a script fails to execute, report the error in one line, diagnose the likely cause
  (missing package, data format mismatch, wrong column name), and present a fix.
- Do NOT retry the same script more than once without modifying it or asking the user.
- If an R package is unavailable, suggest `install.packages()` and wait for user confirmation.
- For prediction models: always include calibration assessment (Brier score, calibration plot,
  or calibration slope/intercept) alongside discrimination metrics. AUC alone is insufficient.

## Output Conventions

### Tables

**Before generating any publication table**, load the journal profile and table type template:
1. Load `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/table-standards/journal-profiles/{journal}.yaml` if a target journal is known
2. Load `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/table-standards/table-types/{type}.md` for the relevant table type
3. If no journal specified, default to AMA style (Radiology profile)

**Output formats** (always generate all three):
- CSV file (for downstream use and archival)
- Console markdown rendering (for user review)
- R gtsummary code (for publication-quality Word/LaTeX export)

**Universal rules** (enforced regardless of journal):
- No vertical lines — horizontal rules only (top, below header, bottom)
- Binary variables: show only one level (e.g., Male only, not Male + Female)
- Units in column headers, not repeated in cells
- Consistent decimal places within each column
- All abbreviations defined in footnotes, self-contained per table
- Exact P values always (never "NS" or "significant")
- Name the statistical test in footnote or general note
- Variability measure always stated: mean (SD) or median (IQR)

**Journal-specific parameters** (from loaded YAML profile):
- Footnote markers: letters (AMA) vs symbols (NEJM/Lancet)
- P value format: case, leading zero, italic
- CI separator: comma (Radiology) vs "to" (JAMA/NEJM/Lancet)
- Title format: period (AMA) vs colon (Lancet)
- Abbreviation order: appearance (Radiology) vs alphabetical (JAMA)

**Footnote placement order** (universal):
1. General note (no marker) — e.g., "Data are mean (SD) unless noted"
2. Abbreviations — in order per journal convention
3. Specific notes (superscript markers) — per-cell explanations
4. Probability notes — significance thresholds (if applicable)

**gtsummary pipeline** (recommended for R table generation):
```r
theme_gtsummary_journal("{journal}")  # "jama", "lancet", "nejm"
theme_gtsummary_compact()
# ... build table ...
tbl %>% as_flex_table() %>% flextable::save_as_docx(path = "table.docx")
```

**Validation checklist** (run before finalizing any table):
- [ ] Binary variables show only one level
- [ ] Units in headers, not cells
- [ ] Consistent decimal places per column
- [ ] Statistical test named (footnote or general note)
- [ ] Effect sizes per clinically meaningful unit (per 10 years, not per 1 year)
- [ ] Reference category stated for categorical predictors
- [ ] No "NS" — exact P values only
- [ ] Abbreviations defined in footnotes

### Figures

- Format: PDF (vector, for journal) + PNG (300 DPI, for review)
- Style: Use `figure_style.mplstyle` for consistent appearance
- Font: Arial, 8-10pt
- Colors: Colorblind-safe palette
- Size: 3.5 inches (single column) or 7.0 inches (double column) width
- Always include axis labels with units

### Console Output

- Formatted for direct copy-paste into the Results section of a manuscript
- Include all numbers that would appear in the text
- Use the reporting format conventions above

## Analysis-Specific Guidelines

### Table 1 (Demographics)

- Template: `references/templates/table1_demographics.py`
- Table type guide: `references/table-standards/table-types/table1_demographics.md`
- Continuous variables: mean +/- SD if normal, median (IQR) if skewed
- Categorical variables: n (%)
- Binary variables: show only one level (e.g., Male n (%), not both Male and Female)
- Compare groups: t-test/Mann-Whitney for continuous, chi-square/Fisher for categorical
- Report standardized mean differences (SMD) if requested (preferred over P for PS-matched studies)
- RCTs: P values in Table 1 are usually unnecessary per CONSORT
- gtsummary `tbl_summary()` with journal theme for R pipeline

### Diagnostic Accuracy

- Template: `references/templates/diagnostic_accuracy.py`
- Always report: sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, accuracy, AUC
- CIs: Wilson score for proportions, DeLong for AUC
- ROC curve: include diagonal reference line, AUC in legend
- If comparing models: DeLong test for AUC comparison
- Youden's index for optimal threshold when applicable
- Include calibration assessment (Brier score, calibration plot) for prediction models
- **NRI/IDI**: When comparing two models (e.g., base model vs model + AI score), report:
  - Category-based NRI (with clinically defined risk categories)
  - Continuous NRI (note: tends to be inflated — report alongside category-based)
  - IDI (Integrated Discrimination Improvement)
  - Bootstrap 95% CIs (1000+ iterations)
  - These supplement, not replace, DeLong AUC comparison

### Inter-rater Agreement

- Template: `references/templates/agreement_analysis.py`
- 2 raters + categorical: Cohen's kappa
- 2+ raters + categorical: Fleiss' kappa (or Krippendorff's alpha)
- Continuous: ICC (specify model: one-way, two-way random/mixed; type: single/average)
- Always report interpretation labels (Landis & Koch or Cicchetti)
- Bland-Altman plot for continuous paired measurements
- Bootstrap CIs (1000 iterations, seed=42)

### Meta-analysis

- Prefer R (meta/metafor packages) for meta-analysis
- **Comparative**: `metabin()` for binary outcomes (OR/RR), `metagen()` for continuous
  - Use `method = "Inverse"`, `method.tau = "DL"`, `method.random.ci = "HK"`
  - Avoid deprecated args: `comb.fixed` → `common`, `hakn` → `method.random.ci`
- **Single-arm pooled proportion**: `metaprop()` with `sm = "PLOGIT"`, `method.ci = "CP"`
- Heterogeneity: I-squared, Q test, tau-squared
- Forest plot: individual studies + pooled estimate
- Funnel plot + Egger's test for publication bias (note: underpowered k<10)
- Sensitivity analysis: leave-one-out (`metainf()`)
- Subgroup: `update(res, subgroup = variable)`

### DTA Meta-Analysis

- Template: `references/templates/dta_meta_analysis.R`
- Prefer R (`mada`, `meta`, `metafor` packages) for DTA meta-analysis
- **Bivariate model** (Reitsma): `mada::reitsma()` — recommended over separate pooling of Se/Sp
  - Accounts for correlation between sensitivity and specificity
  - Produces SROC curve with confidence + prediction regions
- **Key outputs**: Pooled Se/Sp (95% CI), positive/negative LR, DOR, SROC AUC
- **Threshold effect**: Spearman correlation between logit(Se) and logit(FPR)
  - If significant: interpret single pooled Se/Sp with caution, emphasize SROC curve
- **Forest plots**: Paired (sensitivity + specificity side by side)
- **Publication bias**: Deeks' funnel plot asymmetry test (NOT standard funnel plot)
  - Standard funnel plots are inappropriate for DTA studies
  - Note: underpowered for k < 10
- **Dual approach** (comparative + single-arm):
  - Primary: `metabin()` for comparative studies (OR/RR)
  - Secondary: `metaprop()` with `sm = "PLOGIT"` for single-arm pooled proportion
  - Use `method = "Inverse"`, `method.tau = "DL"`, `method.random.ci = "HK"`
- **Small studies (k < 10)**: bivariate model may not converge; consider narrative synthesis
- **Alternative**: If `mada` unavailable, use `metafor::rma.mv()` with bivariate structure

### Survey/Likert

- Descriptive: median, IQR, frequency distribution per item
- Internal consistency: Cronbach's alpha with item-total correlations
- If comparing groups: Mann-Whitney or Kruskal-Wallis (ordinal data)
- Visualization: diverging stacked bar chart

### Survival Analysis

- Kaplan-Meier curves with number-at-risk table
- Log-rank test for group comparison
- Cox proportional hazards: report HR (95% CI)
- Check proportional hazards assumption (Schoenfeld residuals)
- Report median survival with 95% CI
- **Warranty period / T25**: Time to 25% cumulative incidence. Use `quantile()` from KM fit. If event rate < 25%, report "not reached" and consider Weibull parametric extrapolation for estimation

### Interval-Censored Survival

When exact event times are unknown (e.g., health screening cohorts where status changes are detected at periodic visits), standard KM underestimates time-to-event. Use interval-censored methods:

- **R packages**: `icenReg` (parametric/semi-parametric IC regression), `interval` (NPMLE/Turnbull), `survival` (Surv type "interval2")
- **Turnbull estimator**: Non-parametric MLE for interval-censored data — analogous to KM but accounts for the interval between last negative and first positive observation
- **Parametric IC models**: Weibull or log-logistic via `icenReg::ic_par()`. Report shape/scale parameters and compare AIC across distributions
- **Mid-point imputation**: Simple approximation — event time = midpoint of (last negative, first positive). Acceptable as sensitivity analysis but NOT as primary method
- **When to use**: Serial measurement cohorts (e.g., health screening databases), cancer screening intervals, repeated biomarker assessments
- **Reporting**: State the interval-censored nature of the data explicitly in Methods. Report both standard KM (for comparability with prior literature) and IC estimates (as primary or sensitivity)

### Competing Risks

When death or other events preclude the outcome of interest, standard KM overestimates cumulative incidence (treats competing events as censored). Use competing risk methods:

- **R packages**: `cmprsk` (Fine-Gray), `tidycmprsk` (tidy interface), `survival` (cause-specific Cox)
- **Cumulative incidence function (CIF)**: `cmprsk::cuminc()` — replaces 1-KM for each event type. Gray's test for group comparison
- **Fine-Gray subdistribution hazard**: `cmprsk::crr()` or `tidycmprsk::crr()` — reports subdistribution HR (sHR) with 95% CI. Interpretable as effect on CIF directly
- **Cause-specific Cox**: Standard Cox censoring competing events — reports cause-specific HR. Better for etiology; Fine-Gray better for prognosis/prediction
- **When to use**: Mortality studies with multiple causes of death, cardiovascular events when non-CV death is frequent, any outcome where competing events are common (>5% of total events)
- **Reporting**: Present CIF plots (NOT 1-KM) when competing risks exist. Report both cause-specific HR and subdistribution HR when the research question is etiologic. State which competing events were defined

### Group Comparison

- 2 independent groups: t-test or Mann-Whitney U
- 2 paired groups: paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank
- 3+ independent groups: ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis, with post-hoc
- 3+ paired groups: repeated measures ANOVA or Friedman, with post-hoc
- Always report: test statistic, degrees of freedom, p-value, effect size

### Correlation

- Pearson r (if bivariate normal) or Spearman rho (if not)
- Report: coefficient, 95% CI, p-value
- Scatter plot with regression line and CI band
- For multiple variables: correlation matrix heatmap

### Logistic Regression

- **Guide**: Load `analysis_guides/regression.md` before generating code
- **Template**: `references/templates/regression.py` (set `regression_type = "logistic"`)
- Run univariable analysis first, then multivariable with clinically selected variables
- Required outputs: OR table (univariable + multivariable), C-statistic (95% CI), Hosmer-Lemeshow
- Check VIF < 5, EPV >= 10 (warn if violated)
- Box-Tidwell test for continuous predictor linearity
- Forest plot of adjusted ORs
- NRI/IDI if comparing models (incremental value assessment)

### Linear Regression

- **Guide**: Load `analysis_guides/regression.md` before generating code
- **Template**: `references/templates/regression.py` (set `regression_type = "linear"`)
- Required outputs: coefficient table (β, 95% CI, P), R²/adjusted R², VIF
- Always generate 4-panel diagnostic plot (residuals vs fitted, Q-Q, scale-location, leverage)
- Check assumptions: normality of residuals, homoscedasticity, multicollinearity
- Report both unstandardized β (primary) and standardized β (for effect size comparison)

### Propensity Score

- **Guide**: Load `analysis_guides/propensity_score.md` before generating code
- **Template**: `references/templates/propensity_score.py`
- Step 1: PS estimation (logistic regression)
- Step 2: Apply method (matching with caliper = 0.2 × SD logit PS, IPTW with stabilized weights, or overlap weighting)
- Step 3: Balance assessment — SMD < 0.10 for all covariates, Love plot mandatory
- Step 4: Weighted/matched outcome analysis with robust SE
- Step 5: Sensitivity analysis (E-value for unmeasured confounding)
- Always state the estimand (ATE/ATT/ATO) explicitly
- Recommend overlap weighting as default (no extreme weight issues)

### Repeated Measures

- **Guide**: Load `analysis_guides/repeated_measures.md` before generating code
- **Template**: `references/templates/repeated_measures.py`
- Default method: **LMM** (handles missing data, no sphericity assumption)
- RM ANOVA only if: no missing data AND few time points AND sphericity met
- GEE for: population-averaged effects or non-normal outcomes
- Always convert wide → long format first
- **Time × Group interaction is the key result** — always report and interpret
- Generate spaghetti plot (individual trajectories) + group mean trajectory plot
- For LMM: report random effects structure, covariance structure (CS/AR1/UN), AIC/BIC
- For RM ANOVA: report Mauchly's test, epsilon, correction method (Greenhouse-Geisser)
- If missing > 5%: load `analysis_guides/missing_data.md` and apply MICE before analysis

## Language

- Code and output: English
- Communication with user: Match user's preferred language
- Medical terms: English only

## What This Skill Does NOT Do

- Does not fabricate or simulate data to fill gaps
- Does not choose analysis endpoints -- the user decides the research question
- Does not interpret clinical significance -- only statistical results
- Does not replace biostatistician review for complex designs (e.g., adaptive trials)
