# Manage-Project Skill -- Research Project Management

## Purpose

Scaffold new research projects, track manuscript writing progress, maintain lightweight project memory, generate pre-submission checklists, and create backwards submission timelines. Integrates with all other writing skills and the project-manager agent.

---

## Commands

### `/manage-project init {name} --type {type} --journal {journal}`

Create a complete project scaffold for a new research paper.

**Parameters:**
- `{name}` -- Project identifier (e.g., `nnunet-skull-fracture`, `rfa-meta-analysis`)
- `--type` -- Paper type: `original | meta | case | animal | technical | ai_validation | letter`
- `--journal` -- Target journal: `RYAI | AJR | Radiology | European_Radiology | KJR | INSI | AJNR | generic`

**What it creates:**

```

├── paper/
│   ├── main.qmd               <- Main manuscript (Quarto)

├── PROJECT.md                <- Project identity and scope

├── project_state.json         <- Progress tracking
└── README.md                  <- Project overview
```

**Also creates** `project_state.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "{name}",
  "type": "{type}",
  "journal": "{journal}",
  "created": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "target_submission": null,

    "REVIEW_LOG.md": true
  }
}
```

### `/manage-project status`

Report current progress. Reads `project_state.json`, scans existing files, and checks whether key project memory files are present and aligned.

**Output format:**

```
## Project Status: {name}
Journal: {journal} | Type: {type} | Created: {date}
Target submission: {date or "not set"}

### Phase Progress
[check] Phase 0: Project Init (complete)
[check] Phase 1: Outline (complete)
[check] Phase 2: Tables & Figures (complete)
[work]  Phase 3: Methods (IN PROGRESS)
[wait]  Phase 4: Results (pending)
[wait]  Phase 5: Discussion (pending)
[wait]  Phase 6: Introduction & Abstract (pending)
[wait]  Phase 7: Polish (pending)

### Word Counts
Abstract:     0 / 250 words
Introduction: 0 / 600 words
Methods:      847 / 1000 words  85%
Results:      0 / 900 words
Discussion:   0 / 800 words
Total:        847 / 3500 words (journal limit)

### Quality Gates
Critic score (Methods): 87/100 PASS
Citations verified: 12/12
Reporting guideline: pending

### Project Memory
PROJECT.md: present
STATUS.md: stale (last updated 12 days ago)
CLAIMS.md: missing
DATA_DICTIONARY.md: present
ANALYSIS_PLAN.md: missing
REVIEW_LOG.md: n/a (not in revision)

### Next Steps
1. Complete Methods draft (150 words remaining)
2. Run /analyze-stats for Table 1 and diagnostic accuracy
3. Begin Results (Phase 4)
```

### `/manage-project sync-memory`

Audit and refresh project memory files so other agents can work with less ambiguity.

**What it does:**
- checks for presence of `PROJECT.md`, `STATUS.md`, `CLAIMS.md`, `DATA_DICTIONARY.md`, `ANALYSIS_PLAN.md`, `REVIEW_LOG.md`
- identifies stale or contradictory project metadata
- proposes the minimum files to create or update
- aligns `project_state.json` with the current manuscript phase

**Suggested use cases:**
- before handing the project to `project-manager`
- before a large revision cycle
- when returning to an old folder after weeks or months
- when multiple collaborators are editing in parallel

### `/manage-project timeline {submission_date}`

Generate a backwards timeline from submission date.

**Example:** `/manage-project timeline 2026-05-01`

**Output:**

```
## Backwards Timeline to Submission: 2026-05-01

Week -8 (2026-03-06): Phase 0-2 complete (scaffold, outline, tables)
Week -7 (2026-03-13): Methods draft -> critic pass
Week -6 (2026-03-20): Results draft -> critic pass + /analyze-stats complete
Week -5 (2026-03-27): Discussion draft -> critic pass
Week -4 (2026-04-03): Introduction + Abstract -> critic pass
Week -3 (2026-04-10): AI pattern removal + /check-reporting (reporting guideline)
Week -2 (2026-04-17): /self-review + co-author review
Week -1 (2026-04-24): Final revisions + figures at 300 DPI + /lit verification
SUBMISSION (2026-05-01): Upload to journal portal

Critical path: Statistics must be complete by Week -6.
Run /analyze-stats as soon as data is available.
```

## Integration with Other Skills

When called from `/manage-project init`, automatically:
1. Load the correct journal profile from `write-paper/references/journal_profiles/{JOURNAL}.md`
2. Load the correct paper type template from `write-paper/references/paper_types/{TYPE}.md`
3. Copy the appropriate reporting guideline checklist from `check-reporting/references/checklists/`
4. Set word count targets based on the journal profile

After `/manage-project checklist`, recommend calling:
- `/self-review` for manuscript quality gate
- `/search-lit` to verify all citations
- AI pattern removal (built into `/write-paper` Phase 7)

---

## Project State Conventions

**Phase numbers:**
- 0 = Init (scaffold created)
- 1 = Outline approved
- 2 = Table/Figure shells approved
- 3 = Methods (critic >= 85)
- 4 = Results (critic >= 85)
- 5 = Discussion (critic >= 85)
- 6 = Introduction + Abstract (critic >= 85)
- 7 = Polish complete (AI pattern removal + checklist + self-review >= 80)

**Phase status values:** `pending | in_progress | complete | blocked`
