## Workflow Phases

### Phase 1: Protocol Development

**Goal**: Produce a PROSPERO-ready protocol document.

1. **Structure the research question**:
   - DTA: PIRD (Population, Index test, Reference standard, Diagnosis)
   - Intervention: PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome)

2. **Define eligibility criteria**:
   - Study design (cross-sectional DTA, cohort, RCT, etc.)
   - Population characteristics
   - Index test / intervention specifics
   - Comparator / reference standard
   - Outcome measures (Se/Sp for DTA; effect size for intervention)
   - Exclusion criteria with justification

3. **Plan the search**:
   - Minimum 2 databases (PubMed, Embase recommended; add Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane as needed)
   - Draft Boolean search strategy using PIRD/PICO components
   - Grey literature plan (conference abstracts, trial registries)
   - Language restrictions (state explicitly)
   - Date range with justification

4. **Plan RoB assessment**:
   - Select tool based on type (see table above)
   - State number of independent assessors (minimum 2)
   - Plan for disagreement resolution (consensus, third reviewer)

5. **Plan synthesis**:
   - DTA: bivariate random-effects model (Reitsma) or HSROC (Rutter & Gatsonis)
   - Intervention: random-effects (DerSimonian-Laird or REML)
   - Heterogeneity assessment plan
   - Subgroup / sensitivity analysis plan
   - Publication bias assessment plan

6. **Generate protocol document** (Word or Markdown):
   - PROSPERO-compatible format
   - Include all 22 PROSPERO fields
   - Save to project directory

### Phase 2: Search Strategy

**Goal**: Develop and validate reproducible search strategies.

1. **Build search blocks** from PIRD/PICO:
   - Population block (MeSH + free text)
   - Index test / Intervention block
   - Comparator / Reference standard block (optional)
   - Study design filter (if applicable)

2. **Combine with Boolean operators**:
   - Within blocks: OR
   - Between blocks: AND

3. **Execute search per database** using `/search-lit`:
   - PubMed: MeSH + free text
   - Embase: Emtree + free text
   - Additional databases as specified in protocol

4. **Report search per PRISMA-S** (Rethlefsen et al. 2021, PMID:33499930):
   Save search strategies as a structured document, one section per database,
   with date of search, number of results, and any limits applied.

5. **Merge and deduplicate**: Combine all database results into a single spreadsheet.
   Deduplicate by DOI first, then PMID. Save raw counts for PRISMA flow.

### Phase 3: Screening & Selection

**Goal**: Systematic title/abstract and full-text screening.

#### 3a. 1st Screening (Title/Abstract)
1. Define exclusion codes from protocol (e.g., E1=Not target population, E2=Not intervention, E3=Ineligible type, E4=Non-human, E5=Duplicate).
2. For each record, screen title+abstract against eligibility criteria.
3. Mark each record as INCLUDE or EXCLUDE with reason code.
4. Output: Screening spreadsheet with color-coded INCLUDE (green) / EXCLUDE (red).

#### 3b. 2nd Screening (Full-text)
1. For INCLUDE records, match with available PDFs.
2. Apply full-text exclusion criteria (F1=No extractable outcome, F2=No comparative data, F3=Cannot separate target population data, F4=Inadequate sample/follow-up, F5=Full-text unavailable).
3. Flag comparative studies for priority review.

#### 3c. PRISMA Flow
Track numbers at each stage for PRISMA flow diagram.
Use `/make-figures` to generate PRISMA flow diagram when numbers are finalized.

### Phase 4: Data Extraction

**Goal**: Create standardized extraction forms and extract 2x2 or effect size data.

#### DTA Meta-Analysis:
Generate a data extraction form with:
- Study ID (first author, year)
- Study characteristics (country, design, setting, enrollment period)
- Population (n, age, sex, disease prevalence)
- Index test details (technique, threshold, manufacturer, reader experience)
- Reference standard details
- 2x2 table (TP, FP, FN, TN)
- Additional outcomes (AUC per study, if reported)
- Notes on partial verification, differential verification, uninterpretable results

#### Intervention Meta-Analysis:
Generate a data extraction form with:
- Study ID
- Study characteristics
- Population
- Intervention / comparator details
- Outcome data (means, SDs, event counts, sample sizes)
- Effect measures (OR, RR, HR, MD, SMD as appropriate)

Output: Excel/CSV template for data entry.

#### Data Extraction Cross-Verification

When comparing extraction results between independent reviewers (minimum 2), check:

1. **Denominator consistency**: Verify sample sizes match between reviewers. Watch for per-patient vs per-lesion/per-tumor unit confusion. If denominators differ, return to the original paper's Tables/Flow diagram.
2. **Arithmetic verification**: Back-calculate proportions from event/total counts and cross-check against original text (e.g., 78/91 = 85.7%).
3. **Kaplan-Meier estimate distinction**: KM curve estimates differ from raw event counts. Always record the data source (Table vs KM curve vs text) during extraction.
4. **Discrepancy resolution**: List all discrepancies → verify against original text → reach consensus → if consensus fails, use third reviewer. Log all consensus decisions in `{project}/consensus_log.md`.
5. **Dataset lock**: After resolving all discrepancies, lock the final dataset. Any subsequent changes require documented justification with date.

### Phase 5: Risk of Bias Assessment

**Goal**: Guide structured RoB assessment with the appropriate tool.

Select tool based on meta-analysis type (see table above), then read the corresponding checklist:

| Tool | Checklist File |
|------|---------------|
| QUADAS-2 (DTA) | `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/checklists/QUADAS2.md` |
| RoB 2 (RCT) | `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/checklists/RoB2.md` |
| ROBINS-I (NRSI) | `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/checklists/ROBINS_I.md` |
| PROBAST (Prediction) | `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/checklists/PROBAST.md` |
| NOS (Observational) | `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/checklists/NOS.md` |

For AI/ML prediction models, also apply PROBAST+AI extensions.

**Output**: Summary table + traffic light plot (use `/make-figures`).

### Phase 6: Statistical Synthesis

**Goal**: Execute meta-analysis and generate publication-ready outputs.

**IMPORTANT**: Always use R for meta-analysis (packages: `meta`, `metafor`, `mada`).
See `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/r_templates.md` for code templates.

#### DTA Meta-Analysis (R code):

```r
library(mada)      # bivariate model, forest/SROC plots
library(meta)      # general meta-analysis utilities
library(metafor)   # advanced models

# Bivariate model (recommended for DTA)
fit <- reitsma(data, formula = cbind(tsens, tfpr) ~ 1)
summary(fit)

# SROC curve with confidence and prediction regions
plot(fit, sroclwd = 2, main = "SROC Curve")

# Forest plot (paired: sensitivity + specificity)
forest(fit, type = "sens")
forest(fit, type = "spec")
```

Key outputs for DTA:
- Pooled sensitivity (95% CI)
- Pooled specificity (95% CI)
- Pooled positive LR, negative LR
- Pooled DOR
- SROC curve with AUC, confidence region, prediction region
- Heterogeneity: I-squared for sensitivity and specificity separately
- Threshold effect: Spearman correlation between sensitivity and FPR

#### Intervention Meta-Analysis (R code):

```r
library(meta)
library(metafor)

res <- metagen(TE, seTE, data = dat, studlab = study,
               method.tau = "REML", sm = "OR")
forest(res)
funnel(res)

summary(res)  # I-squared, tau-squared, Q test
metabias(res, method.bias = "Egger")
metainf(res, pooled = "random")  # leave-one-out
```

#### Dual Approach: Comparative + Single-Arm Pooled Proportion

When comparative studies are limited, use dual approach (precedent: Lin 2025 PMID:41419890,
Su 2026 PMID:41653198):

```r
# PRIMARY: Comparative MA (binary outcomes)
res_comp <- metabin(ei, ni, ec, nc, data = dat,
                     studlab = study, sm = "OR",
                     method = "Inverse", method.tau = "DL",
                     common = FALSE, random = TRUE,
                     method.random.ci = "HK", incr = 0.5)

# SECONDARY: Single-arm pooled proportion
res_prop <- metaprop(event, n, data = dat_single,
                      studlab = study, sm = "PLOGIT",
                      method.tau = "DL", method.ci = "CP")
```

Key points:
- Comparative answers "is adjunct effective?" -- single-arm answers "what outcomes to expect?"
- Single-arm uses `metaprop()` with logit transformation + Clopper-Pearson CI
- GRADE certainty lower for single-arm -- state explicitly
- Report both in Results: "Primary (comparative)" then "Secondary (pooled proportion)"

#### Practical R Notes:
- Use `method = "Inverse"` not `"MH"` to avoid method.tau conflict
- Use `method.tau = "DL"` (DerSimonian-Laird) -- REML may not converge with sparse data
- Use `method.random.ci = "HK"` (Hartung-Knapp) instead of deprecated `hakn = TRUE`
- Use `common = FALSE, random = TRUE` instead of deprecated `comb.fixed/comb.random`
- For zero cells, `incr = 0.5` continuity correction
- Egger's test underpowered for k < 10 -- note this in results

#### Subgroup / Meta-Regression:
- Subgroup analysis for pre-specified covariates
- Meta-regression for continuous moderators
- Report interaction test p-value, not just within-subgroup p-values

#### Publication Bias:
- DTA: Deeks' funnel plot asymmetry test (standard funnel plots inappropriate for DTA)
- Intervention: Funnel plot + Egger's or Peters' test
- Note: Tests underpowered for <10 studies

#### Sensitivity Analysis:
- Leave-one-out analysis (`metainf()`)
- Excluding high RoB studies
- Excluding overlapping populations (same institution + enrollment period)
- Including/excluding borderline studies (sensitivity to inclusion criteria)
- Alternative model specifications

### Phase 7: GRADE / Certainty of Evidence

**Goal**: Assess certainty of the body of evidence.

For DTA meta-analysis, apply GRADE-DTA framework:
1. Risk of bias (from QUADAS-2)
2. Indirectness (applicability concerns)
3. Inconsistency (heterogeneity)
4. Imprecision (wide CIs, small sample)
5. Publication bias

For intervention meta-analysis, apply standard GRADE.

Output: Summary of Findings table.

### Phase 8: Reporting & Manuscript

**Goal**: Generate PRISMA-compliant manuscript sections.

1. **Check reporting compliance**: Use `/check-reporting` with PRISMA-DTA or PRISMA 2020
2. **Write manuscript**: Use `/write-paper` with meta-analysis type selected
3. **Figures**: Use `/make-figures` for:
   - PRISMA flow diagram
   - Forest plots (paired for DTA)
   - SROC curve (DTA)
   - Funnel plot
   - RoB summary (traffic light plot)
4. **Tables**:
   - Characteristics of included studies
   - 2x2 data per study (DTA)
   - RoB assessment results
   - Summary of findings / GRADE table

## DTA-Specific Pitfalls (Always Check)

| Pitfall | Problem | Solution |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Separate pooling of Se/Sp | Ignores correlation | Use bivariate/HSROC model |
| Ignoring threshold effect | False heterogeneity | Check Spearman correlation, SROC plot |
| Standard funnel plot for DTA | Inappropriate | Use Deeks' funnel plot |
| I-squared only for heterogeneity | Doesn't capture threshold effect | Use prediction region on SROC |
| Missing GRADE | Common omission in DTA MA | Apply GRADE-DTA, or state as limitation |
| Partial verification bias | Inflates sensitivity | Assess in QUADAS-2 Flow & Timing domain |
| Unevaluable results excluded | Biases accuracy estimates | Report intent-to-diagnose analysis |

---

## Small Study Considerations

When the number of included studies is small (< 10):
- Bivariate/HSROC model may not converge -- consider univariate random-effects as fallback
- Publication bias tests are underpowered -- state this limitation
- Subgroup/meta-regression analysis not recommended
- Wide prediction regions expected -- emphasize uncertainty in conclusions
- Consider narrative synthesis as alternative/complement

| Need statistical code | `/analyze-stats` | Execute R/Python analysis scripts |
| Need figures | `/make-figures` | PRISMA flow, forest plots, SROC, funnel plots |
| Need reporting check | `/check-reporting` | PRISMA-DTA / PRISMA 2020 compliance |
| Need manuscript writing | `/write-paper` | Full IMRAD manuscript generation |
| Need self-review | `/self-review` | Pre-submission quality check |

## Error Handling

- If study type is ambiguous (DTA vs intervention), ask user to clarify before proceeding.
- If fewer than 4 studies for DTA, warn that bivariate model may not converge.
- If data extraction is incomplete (missing 2x2 cells), suggest contacting authors or sensitivity analysis with imputed values.
- If PROSPERO ID is missing, flag as a limitation but continue.
- Always remind user: this is a methodological support tool; final decisions rest with the research team and ideally include a biostatistician/methodologist.
