# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added — Verified neurointervention/cerebrovascular journal profiles

- **JNIS (Journal of NeuroInterventional Surgery)** — compact + detail profiles built from user-supplied author-guidelines PDF (BMJ, SNIS). Covers double-anonymised review, ORCID mandate, BMJ Tier 3 data-sharing policy, Key Messages box requirement, AI policy aligned with BMJ/ICMJE.
- **Journal of Stroke** (Korean Stroke Society) — compact + detail profiles from user-supplied author-guidelines PDF. Full OA CC BY-NC 4.0 with no APC; Vancouver numbered references; structured 250-word abstract for Original Articles; mRS/mTICI/sICH definition requirements; AI policy defaults to ICMJE/WAME (no explicit journal-specific text).
- **Stroke (AHA/ASA)** — compact + detail profiles from user-supplied author-instructions PDFs. ISSN verified against ISSN Portal (print 0039-2499 / online 1524-4628, ISSN-L 0039-2499). Three-category science triage (Basic/Translational, Clinical, Population); structured 300-word abstract; Vancouver references listing first 10 authors + "et al."; 90-day revision window with mandatory Graphic Abstract at revision; explicit AI policy per AHA/ICMJE.

All three profiles follow the two-tier public-library format established by `INSI.md` and include a verification note citing the 2026-04-19 user-supplied PDF as source.

### Added — `/find-journal` Phase 3.6 Profile Coverage Advisory

Previously, when the public profile library had a known gap for the manuscript's field,
the ranking silently substituted adjacent journals and the user never learned that a
better-fitting target existed. The new Phase 3.6 scans `skills/find-journal/TODO_*_profiles.md`
files, matches their `## Field Keywords` block against the manuscript's themes, and appends
a Coverage Advisory block between the comparison note and the Mandatory Disclaimer when
a relevant TODO has still-missing journals. The advisory names the missing journals,
cites their publisher and 1-line rationale verbatim from the TODO file, and directs the
user to `/add-journal` with a PDF to close the gap per `POLICY.md`. No false alarms when
no TODO is relevant.

`TODO_neurointervention_profiles.md` updated with a `## Field Keywords` section so it
feeds the advisory. Future field TODO files should follow the same convention.

### Added — `/write-paper` Step 7.3a trigger 5 (reporting-quality checklist SRs)

Step 7.3a Numerical Claim Audit previously fired only on pooled estimates, comparative-arm
values, `[VERIFY-CSV]` tags, or post-v1 revisions. It missed the reporting-quality
systematic review pattern, where all headline numbers are derived by counting cells in an
items × studies checklist matrix (TRIPOD+AI, PROBAST+AI, CLAIM, PRISMA, STARD, CHARMS,
ARRIVE). The same failure class applies — hand-tallied totals drift from cell-level truth
while every downstream artifact echoes the wrong number.

Trigger 5 is now mandatory whenever the manuscript reports corpus-level, study-level, or
item-level PRESENT / PARTIAL / ABSENT / compliance counts or percentages from a checklist
synthesis. The procedure adds five steps specific to this pattern: per-study totals
recomputation, corpus-level Σ non-NA denominator, item-level roll-up, 3-way consistency
(manuscript ↔ per-study JSON ↔ summary document), and a reproducible audit script that
emits `numerical_claims_log.csv` and exits non-zero on any mismatch.

Precedent: FD Occlusion AI SR v1.0 → v1.1 corpus PRESENT 61.2% → 50.8% (2026-04-19,
~10 pp delta) survived internal consistency until manual cell-level recomputation
exposed it. `~/.claude/rules/numerical-safety.md` updated with the companion rule.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-04-19

### Added — Numerical Hallucination Prevention Layer

A real incident during a revision run exposed that the citation-safety pipeline did not have
a symmetric counterpart for numerical claims. Citations were verified end-to-end against
PubMed (0 fabricated refs), while a hand-typed `matrix()` in a revision-era R script silently
reversed a Fisher exact 2x2 ("3/45 vs 0/56, p=0.085" where the source said "0/45 vs 1/56,
p=0.37"). Every internal consistency check passed because every artifact echoed the same
wrong number. Detection required an explicitly requested second-pass audit with random
sampling against the primary paper.

To close that gap, four skills now enforce a common 3-layer (CSV ↔ analysis script ↔
manuscript) audit, with additional back-checking against the primary paper for revisions and
pooled estimates:

- **`/meta-analysis` Phase 6b — Post-Analysis Source Fidelity Audit (new).** After Phase 6
  statistical synthesis, mandates no hand-typed numerical matrices when a CSV exists,
  separate consensus-log rows for comparative-arm subsets, and a random 3-claim back-check
  (manuscript → R output → primary-source Table/Figure) before advancing to GRADE. A single
  mismatch is a P0 blocker.
- **`/self-review` Phase 2.5a — Numerical Source-Fidelity Audit (new).** Complements the
  existing Phase 2.5 internal consistency check with external validation: stratified random
  sampling of 5 claims, 3-layer traversal (manuscript ↔ CSV ↔ primary paper), and escalation
  of any mismatch to Major Comment. Revision-introduced numbers and comparative-arm specific
  values are the two highest-yield strata and are always sampled.
- **`/revise` Step 2.5 — Revision Numerical Lineage Check (new).** Any `/analyze-stats`
  re-run during revision must tag new numerical claims with `[VERIFY-CSV]`, read inputs from
  the locked extraction CSV, and maintain a response-document audit table that maps each new
  number to its source script:line + CSV coordinate + primary-source location. Prose
  generation is gated on the audit clearing.
- **`/write-paper` Step 7.3a — Numerical Claim Audit (new).** Sits alongside the existing
  citation verification step. Triggered whenever the manuscript contains pooled estimates,
  comparative-arm values, `[VERIFY-CSV]` tags, or is a post-v1 revision. Greps all analysis
  scripts for hand-typed numerical literals without CSV-coordinate comments and flags them
  as structural risks regardless of current correctness.

All four skills cite the CBCT Ablation MA-2 Du 2023 incident as precedent to make the
failure mode concrete rather than abstract. Complementary companion rules were added to
`~/.claude/rules/data-integrity.md` and a new `~/.claude/rules/numerical-safety.md` so the
gates trigger even in non-skill workflows.

## [2.2.1] - 2026-04-18

### Added

- **`/meta-analysis` Phase 3 multi-round screening structure**: Phase 3a now distinguishes Round 1 (single-reviewer initial screen), Round 2 (dual independent screen with Cohen's kappa), Round 3 (first-reviewer adjudication of disagreements), Round 4 (full-text), and PRISMA flow.
- **AI-assisted pre-screening template** (`meta-analysis/references/ai_pre_screening_template.py`): reusable script for compressing R3 adjudication. Generates AI suggestions only; first reviewer must independently confirm or overturn each. Includes Methods boilerplate citing model name and version. Companion priority-sort logic built in.

### Changed

- **`/meta-analysis` SKILL.md**: Phase 3 expanded from 17 to 39 lines (3a–3e). Maintains kappa requirement and adds explicit guidance for handling MAYBE-tagged records.

### Changed

- **cross-national**: Expanded from 2-country to 3-country support (KNHANES+NHANES+CHNS). Added ~100 lines of validated variable codings for KNHANES, NHANES, and CHNS with specific warnings (BMI cutoffs, hemoglobin units, survey weight handling). Added composite score replication warnings from LE8 validation.
- **batch-cohort**: Added physician-diagnosis requirement for outcome definitions (rule 8) and full 8-covariate default (rule 9). Expanded self-adjustment removal for education/income/MetS.
- **replicate-study**: Added 3-country harmonization reference.

### Infrastructure

- All 32 skills now pass `validate_skills.sh` with 0 FAIL.
- Quality tier distribution: 15 HIGH (300+ lines), 14 MID (150-300), 3 THIN (<150).

## [2.1.0] - 2026-04-15

### Added

- **find-cohort-gap**: New skill for systematic research gap discovery from cohort databases. 6-phase pipeline (cohort intake → PI profiling → intersection matrix → literature saturation scan → 6-Pattern scoring with comparison tables → feasibility gate → ranked one-pager proposals). Works with any cohort: NHIS, UK Biobank, institutional EMR, health checkup registries. Includes 4 reference files (pattern scoring rubric, cohort profile template, one-pager template, saturation query templates). Integrates with `/search-lit` for PubMed searches and feeds into `/design-study` → `/write-paper` pipeline.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-04-14

### Changed

- **Demos regenerated with `orchestrate --e2e` pipeline.** All 3 demos now produce a consistent artifact set: `analyze.{py,R}`, `_analysis_outputs.md`, `_pipeline_log.md`, `manuscript.md`, `manuscript_final.docx`, `reporting_checklist.md`, `review_comments.md`, `figures/_figure_manifest.md`, and study-type-specific tables and figures.
- Demo output structure flattened: `tables/` replaces `output/` for CSV files; manuscript and QC artifacts live at demo root.
- Previous demo scripts and outputs archived to `demo/_archive/` for reference.

### Added
