## Why This Repo?

| | MedSci Skills | Aggregator repos (400-900 skills) |
|---|---|---|
| **Citation quality** | Every reference verified via PubMed / Semantic Scholar / CrossRef API. Zero hallucinated citations. | No verification -- citations generated from model memory |
| **Pipeline integration** | Skills call each other in defined chains. `design-study` -> `calc-sample-size` -> `write-protocol`. | Standalone stubs with no cross-skill interaction |
| **End-to-end coverage** | From IRB protocol to journal submission: sample size, data cleaning, analysis, writing, compliance, journal selection, cover letter. | Gaps at every transition -- no protocol, no journal matching, no cover letter |
| **Battle-tested** | Used on real manuscript submissions by a practicing physician-researcher | Unknown provenance and validation |
| **Depth per skill** | 150-600 lines of documentation + bundled reference files (40 journal profiles, checklists, formula sheets, code templates) | Typically thin SKILL.md templates |

> **Tip:** Not sure which skill to use? Start with `/orchestrate` -- it will classify your request and route you to the right tool.

## Key Features

### End-to-End Pipeline (New in v2.1)
`orchestrate` now supports Full Pipeline Mode: load your data and get a complete manuscript with figures, compliance audit, and presentation slides -- without manually invoking each skill. Skills pass outputs via `_analysis_outputs.md` manifests, so downstream tools auto-discover tables, figures, and predictions.

### Anti-Hallucination Citations
Every reference produced by `search-lit` is verified against PubMed, Semantic Scholar, or CrossRef APIs. No citation is ever generated from memory alone. API errors are batched silently -- no token waste from repeated failure messages.

### 20 Reporting Guidelines & RoB Tools Built-in
`check-reporting` includes bundled checklists for STROBE, STARD, TRIPOD, TRIPOD+AI, PRISMA, PRISMA-DTA, MOOSE, ARRIVE, CONSORT, CARE, SPIRIT, CLAIM, SQUIRE 2.0, CLEAR, GRRAS, QUADAS-2, RoB 2, ROBINS-I, PROBAST, and NOS. Now includes Results/Discussion section boundary checks.

### Publication-Ready Output
`analyze-stats` generates reproducible Python/R code with mandatory calibration for prediction models. `make-figures` produces journal-specification figures (300 DPI, colorblind-safe palettes, proper dimensions) with a tool selection guide (D2 for flow diagrams, matplotlib for data plots).

### Results/Discussion Boundary Enforcement
`write-paper` enforces strict separation: Results contain only factual findings (no interpretation, no "why"), Discussion uses interactive anchor-paper scaffolding. The critic rubric includes a dedicated Section Boundaries pass/fail gate.

### IRB Protocol to Submission in One Pipeline
`design-study` -> `calc-sample-size` -> `write-protocol` gives you an IRB-ready protocol. After data collection: `clean-data` -> `analyze-stats` -> `write-paper` -> `self-review` -> `find-journal` -> cover letter. Every transition is a defined skill handoff.

### Skills Work Together
Skills call each other. `check-reporting` invokes `make-figures` for PRISMA diagrams. `write-paper` calls `search-lit` for citation verification. `self-review` delegates reporting compliance to `check-reporting`. `calc-sample-size` output feeds directly into `write-protocol`'s IRB justification section.

## Requirements

- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) CLI or IDE extension
- Python 3.9+ (for statistical analysis and figure generation)
- R 4.0+ with `meta` (>=7.0), `metafor` (>=4.0), `mada` (>=0.5.11) packages (for meta-analysis)
