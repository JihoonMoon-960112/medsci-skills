Detects PHI via regex + heuristics. Interactive terminal review, pseudonymization, date shifting, mapping file generation. Custom locale support via `--locale-file`. |
| **clean-data** | Interactive data profiling and cleaning assistant. Three-stage workflow: profile your CSV/Excel data, flag issues (missing values, outliers, duplicates, type mismatches), then generate cleaning code for approved actions only. PHI/PII safety warnings built-in. |

## Key Features

### Autonomous E2E Pipeline (v2.2)
`orchestrate --e2e` or `write-paper --autonomous` runs the full pipeline from data to submission-ready DOCX with zero human intervention. Skills pass outputs via structured manifests (`_analysis_outputs.md`, `_figure_manifest.md`) with post-skill validation: if a skill fails to produce expected outputs, the pipeline halts rather than proceeding with missing data. Phase 7 enforces a strict QC chain: AI pattern removal → reporting compliance check → citation verification → self-review with auto-fix (max 2 iterations) → DOCX build with embedded figures and tables.

### Anti-Hallucination Citations
Every reference produced by `search-lit` is verified against PubMed, Semantic Scholar, or CrossRef APIs. No citation is ever generated from memory alone. API errors are batched silently -- no token waste from repeated failure messages.

### 33 Reporting Guidelines & RoB Tools Built-in
`check-reporting` includes bundled checklists for 33 guidelines and risk-of-bias tools: STROBE, STARD, STARD-AI, TRIPOD, TRIPOD+AI, PRISMA 2020, PRISMA-DTA, PRISMA-P, MOOSE, ARRIVE, CONSORT, CARE, SPIRIT, CLAIM, SQUIRE 2.0, CLEAR, GRRAS, MI-CLEAR-LLM, SWiM, AMSTAR 2, QUADAS-2, QUADAS-C, RoB 2, ROBINS-I, ROBINS-E, ROBIS, ROB-ME, PROBAST, PROBAST+AI, NOS, COSMIN, RoB NMA. Includes Results/Discussion section boundary checks and machine-readable JSON summary for pipeline integration.

### Publication-Ready Output
`analyze-stats` generates reproducible Python/R code for 13 analysis types -- including regression, propensity score, and repeated measures -- with mandatory calibration for prediction models. `make-figures` produces journal-specification figures (300 DPI, colorblind-safe palettes, proper dimensions), visual/graphical abstracts, and a tool selection guide (D2 for flow diagrams, matplotlib for data plots). `--study-type` auto-generates the complete figure set for each study design.

### Results/Discussion Boundary Enforcement
`write-paper` enforces strict separation: Results contain only factual findings (no interpretation, no "why"), Discussion uses interactive anchor-paper scaffolding. The critic rubric includes a dedicated Section Boundaries pass/fail gate.

### IRB Protocol to Submission in One Pipeline
`design-study` -> `calc-sample-size` -> `write-protocol` gives you an IRB-ready protocol. After data collection: `clean-data` -> `analyze-stats` -> `write-paper` -> `self-review` -> `find-journal` -> cover letter. Every transition is a defined skill handoff.

### Skills Work Together
Skills call each other. `check-reporting` invokes `make-figures` for PRISMA diagrams. `write-paper` calls `search-lit` for citation verification. `self-review` delegates reporting compliance to `check-reporting`. `calc-sample-size` output feeds directly into `write-protocol`'s IRB justification section.

## Requirements

- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) CLI or IDE extension
- Python 3.9+ (for statistical analysis and figure generation)
- R 4.0+ with `meta` (>=7.0), `metafor` (>=4.0), `mada` (>=0.5.11) packages (for meta-analysis)

## Use Cases

/make-figures          # Create ROC curve + STARD flow diagram
/check-reporting       # Audit against STARD checklist
```

**"I'm starting a meta-analysis and need to find relevant studies."**
```
/search-lit            # Systematic search across PubMed + Semantic Scholar
/fulltext-retrieval    # Batch download open-access PDFs for included studies
/meta-analysis         # Full DTA or intervention MA pipeline
/make-figures          # Forest plot + PRISMA flow diagram
/check-reporting       # Audit against PRISMA-DTA checklist
```

**"I need to present a paper at journal club."**

/present-paper         # Analyze paper, find supporting refs, draft speaker script
```

**"I need to submit an IRB protocol for a new study."**
```
/search-lit            # Background literature for rationale
/design-study          # Validate study design, identify bias risks
/calc-sample-size      # Power analysis with IRB justification text
/write-protocol        # Generate 4 core sections + 6 skeleton sections
```

**"I have an interesting case to publish."**
```
/write-paper           # Case report mode (CARE 2016, 1000-word short-form)
/self-review           # Pre-submission self-check
/find-journal          # Which journal accepts case reports in this field?
```

**"My paper was rejected. Where else should I submit?"**
```
/find-journal          # Exclude rejected journal, recommend alternatives
/write-paper           # Generate new cover letter (Phase 8+)
```

**"I have messy clinical data that needs cleaning before analysis."**
```
/deidentify            # Remove PHI from clinical data (standalone Python, no LLM)
/clean-data            # Profile dataset, flag issues, generate cleaning code
/analyze-stats         # Run statistics on cleaned data
/make-figures          # Publication-ready figures
```

**"I want to write a grant proposal for a radiology AI project."**
```
/design-study          # Validate study design before writing
/grant-builder         # Structure significance, innovation, approach
/search-lit            # Find supporting literature with verified citations
```
