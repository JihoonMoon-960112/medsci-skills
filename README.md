## Why This Repo?

| | MedSci Skills | Aggregator repos (400-900 skills) |
|---|---|---|
| **Citation quality** | Every reference verified via PubMed / Semantic Scholar / CrossRef API. Zero hallucinated citations. | No verification -- citations generated from model memory |
| **Pipeline integration** | Skills call each other. `check-reporting` invokes `make-figures` for PRISMA diagrams. | Standalone stubs with no cross-skill interaction |
| **Battle-tested** | Used on real manuscript submissions by a practicing physician-researcher | Unknown provenance and validation |
| **Depth per skill** | 200-380 lines of documentation + bundled reference files (checklists, figure specs) | Typically thin SKILL.md templates |

### Available Now

| Skill | What It Does |
|-------|-------------|
| **orchestrate** | Single entry point for the full bundle. Classifies your request and routes to the right skill -- or chains multiple skills for multi-step workflows. Start here if you're unsure which skill to use. |
| **search-lit** | PubMed + Semantic Scholar + bioRxiv search with anti-hallucination citation verification. Token-efficient error handling -- CrossRef failures are silently batched, not repeated. |
| **fulltext-retrieval** | Batch open-access PDF downloader. Unpaywall → PMC → OpenAlex → CrossRef pipeline. OA-only -- no paywall bypass. Input: DOI list or TSV. |
| **check-reporting** | Manuscript compliance audit against 15 reporting guidelines and risk of bias tools (STROBE, STARD, TRIPOD+AI, PRISMA, PRISMA-DTA, ARRIVE, QUADAS-2, RoB 2, ROBINS-I, PROBAST, NOS, and more). Includes Results/Discussion section boundary check. |
| **analyze-stats** | Statistical analysis code generation (Python/R) for diagnostic accuracy, DTA meta-analysis (bivariate/HSROC), inter-rater agreement, survival analysis, and demographics tables. Calibration mandatory for prediction models. |
| **meta-analysis** | Full systematic review and meta-analysis pipeline (8 phases). DTA (bivariate/HSROC) and intervention meta-analysis. Protocol to submission-ready manuscript with PRISMA-DTA compliance. |
| **make-figures** | Publication-ready figures: ROC curves, forest plots, PRISMA/CONSORT/STARD flow diagrams, Kaplan-Meier curves, Bland-Altman plots, confusion matrices. |
| **design-study** | Study design review: identifies analysis unit, cohort logic, data leakage risks, comparator design, validation strategy, and reporting guideline fit. |
| **intake-project** | Classifies new research projects, summarizes current state, identifies missing inputs, and recommends next steps. |
| **grant-builder** | Structures grant proposals: significance, innovation, approach, milestones, and consortium roles. |
| **present-paper** | Academic presentation preparation: paper analysis, supporting research, speaker scripts, slide note injection, and Q&A prep. |
| **publish-skill** | Convert personal Claude Code skills into distributable, open-source-ready packages. PII audit, license compatibility check, generalization, and packaging workflow. |
| **write-paper** | Full IMRAD manuscript pipeline (8 phases). Outline to submission-ready manuscript with critic-fixer loops, AI pattern avoidance, and journal compliance. Anti-interpretation guardrails in Results; interactive Discussion planning with anchor paper input. |
| **self-review** | Pre-submission self-review from reviewer perspective. 10 categories with research-type branching (AI, observational, educational, meta-analysis, case report, surgical). Anticipated Major/Minor format with severity framing and optional R0 numbering for `/revise` pipeline. |
| **revise** | Response to reviewers with tracked changes. Parses decision letters, classifies comments as MAJOR/MINOR/REBUTTAL, generates point-by-point responses and cover letter. |
| **manage-project** | Research project scaffolding and progress tracking. Commands: init, status, sync-memory, checklist, timeline. Backwards submission timelines and pre-submission checklists. |

After copying, restart Claude Code. Skills are automatically discovered from `~/.claude/skills/`.

> **Tip:** Not sure which skill to use? Start with `/orchestrate` -- it will classify your request and route you to the right tool.

## Key Features

### Anti-Hallucination Citations
Every reference produced by `search-lit` is verified against PubMed, Semantic Scholar, or CrossRef APIs. No citation is ever generated from memory alone. API errors are batched silently -- no token waste from repeated failure messages.

### 16 Reporting Guidelines & RoB Tools Built-in
`check-reporting` includes STROBE, STARD, TRIPOD+AI, PRISMA, PRISMA-DTA, ARRIVE, QUADAS-2, RoB 2, ROBINS-I, PROBAST, and NOS checklists. CONSORT, CARE, SPIRIT, and CLAIM are supported via knowledge-based assessment (checklists not bundled due to license restrictions). Now includes Results/Discussion section boundary checks.

### Publication-Ready Output
`analyze-stats` generates reproducible Python/R code with mandatory calibration for prediction models. `make-figures` produces journal-specification figures (300 DPI, colorblind-safe palettes, proper dimensions) with a tool selection guide (D2 for flow diagrams, matplotlib for data plots).

### Results/Discussion Boundary Enforcement
`write-paper` enforces strict separation: Results contain only factual findings (no interpretation, no "why"), Discussion uses interactive anchor-paper scaffolding. The critic rubric includes a dedicated Section Boundaries pass/fail gate.

### Skills Work Together
Skills call each other. `check-reporting` invokes `make-figures` for PRISMA diagrams. `write-paper` calls `search-lit` for citation verification. `self-review` delegates reporting compliance to `check-reporting`.

## Requirements

- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) CLI or IDE extension
- Python 3.9+ (for statistical analysis and figure generation)
- R 4.0+ with `meta` (>=7.0), `metafor` (>=4.0), `mada` (>=0.5.11) packages (for meta-analysis)

## Use Cases

**"I have a diagnostic accuracy study draft and need to check compliance."**
```
/design-study          # Review study design for leakage and bias
/analyze-stats         # Generate DTA statistics (sensitivity, specificity, AUC with CIs)
/make-figures          # Create ROC curve + STARD flow diagram
/check-reporting       # Audit against STARD checklist
```

**"I'm starting a meta-analysis and need to find relevant studies."**
```
/search-lit            # Systematic search across PubMed + Semantic Scholar
/fulltext-retrieval    # Batch download open-access PDFs for included studies
/meta-analysis         # Full DTA or intervention MA pipeline
/make-figures          # Forest plot + PRISMA flow diagram
/check-reporting       # Audit against PRISMA-DTA checklist
```

**"I need to present a paper at journal club."**
```
/present-paper         # Analyze paper, find supporting refs, draft speaker script
```

**"I want to write a grant proposal for a radiology AI project."**
```
/design-study          # Validate study design before writing
/grant-builder         # Structure significance, innovation, approach
