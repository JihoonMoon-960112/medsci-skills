### Available Now

| Skill | What It Does |
|-------|-------------|
| **search-lit** | PubMed + Semantic Scholar + bioRxiv search with anti-hallucination citation verification. Full-text OA retrieval pipeline (Unpaywall, PMC, OpenAlex). |
| **check-reporting** | Manuscript compliance audit against 15 reporting guidelines and risk of bias tools (STROBE, STARD, TRIPOD+AI, PRISMA, PRISMA-DTA, ARRIVE, QUADAS-2, RoB 2, ROBINS-I, PROBAST, NOS, and more). |
| **analyze-stats** | Statistical analysis code generation (Python/R) for diagnostic accuracy, DTA meta-analysis (bivariate/HSROC), inter-rater agreement, survival analysis, and demographics tables. |
| **meta-analysis** | Full systematic review and meta-analysis pipeline (8 phases). DTA (bivariate/HSROC) and intervention meta-analysis. Protocol to submission-ready manuscript with PRISMA-DTA compliance. |
| **make-figures** | Publication-ready figures: ROC curves, forest plots, PRISMA/CONSORT/STARD flow diagrams, Kaplan-Meier curves, Bland-Altman plots, confusion matrices. |
| **design-study** | Study design review: identifies analysis unit, cohort logic, data leakage risks, comparator design, validation strategy, and reporting guideline fit. |
| **intake-project** | Classifies new research projects, summarizes current state, identifies missing inputs, and recommends next steps. |
| **grant-builder** | Structures grant proposals: significance, innovation, approach, milestones, and consortium roles. |
| **present-paper** | Academic presentation preparation: paper analysis, supporting research, speaker scripts, slide note injection, and Q&A prep. |
| **publish-skill** | Convert personal Claude Code skills into distributable, open-source-ready packages. PII audit, license compatibility check, generalization, and packaging workflow. |

### Coming Soon (Phase 2-3)

| Skill | Status |
|-------|--------|
| **write-paper** | Full IMRAD manuscript pipeline (8 phases) |
| **self-review** | Pre-submission self-review from reviewer perspective |
| **revise** | Response to reviewers with tracked changes |
| **manage-project** | Research project scaffolding and progress tracking |

## Installation

### Option 1: Install all skills (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aperivue/medical-research-skills.git
cp -r medical-research-skills/skills/* ~/.claude/skills/
```

### Option 2: Install individual skills

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aperivue/medical-research-skills.git
cp -r medical-research-skills/skills/check-reporting ~/.claude/skills/
```

After copying, restart Claude Code. Skills are automatically discovered from `~/.claude/skills/`.

## Key Features

### Anti-Hallucination Citations
Every reference produced by `search-lit` is verified against PubMed, Semantic Scholar, or CrossRef APIs. No citation is ever generated from memory alone.

### 15 Reporting Guidelines & RoB Tools Built-in
`check-reporting` includes STROBE, STARD, TRIPOD+AI, PRISMA, PRISMA-DTA, ARRIVE, QUADAS-2, RoB 2, ROBINS-I, PROBAST, and NOS checklists. CONSORT, CARE, SPIRIT, and CLAIM are supported via knowledge-based assessment (checklists not bundled due to license restrictions).

### Publication-Ready Output
`analyze-stats` generates reproducible Python/R code. `make-figures` produces journal-specification figures (300 DPI, colorblind-safe palettes, proper dimensions).

### Skills Work Together
Skills can call each other. For example, `check-reporting` can invoke `make-figures` to generate a PRISMA flow diagram, or `analyze-stats` to fill in missing statistical details.

## Requirements

- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) CLI or IDE extension
- Python 3.9+ (for statistical analysis and figure generation)
- R 4.0+ with `meta` (>=7.0), `metafor` (>=4.0), `mada` (>=0.5.11) packages (for meta-analysis)

These skills are research productivity tools. They do **not** provide clinical decision support, medical advice, or diagnostic recommendations. All outputs should be reviewed by qualified researchers before use in any publication or clinical context.
